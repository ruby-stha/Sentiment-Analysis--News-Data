And as is usually the case there is very little information available as to what specifics must be adhered to and in what specific order. ,1

Jul 2 2016- It is difficult to write about gods and religion. No not just because religion has become such asensitive topic to deal with in recent times.

Jul 2 2016- I am twenty-six one month shy of my twenty-seventh birthday. I am neither old nor young. I am in that stage when the stiffness in one  loins is relaxing weaving the crochet of veins for the impending motherhood. Some days I feel a heaviness in my breasts and a gentle stifling in my womb.

She is so tiny so rudimentary but even then asserting herself with the primordial force of the demiurge.This morning I saw a girl whose father used to be quite fond of me. He is dead now. ,0
Khaptad is a three days trip from Kathmandu. The ride from Kathmandu through Dhangadhi Dadeldhura Baitadi and Lamataula in Bajhang takes two days.The rest of the forestry journey through Darugau and Lokhada would take around eight hours of walk to finally reach Khaptad.It is a rare landscape that you encounter in Khaptad the meeting point of Bajhang Bajura Doti and Accham. Smooth plateaus round up the horizons and serene lakes rest below; curves and lines intersecting to make these dune-like hillocks capped by pine forests above and grazed by abandoned cattle below. In winter the plateaus are covered in blankets of snow but the trees rise high almost untouched. These sights are powerful enough to make you want to leave the Valley permanently for the far far west.Khaptad might not be a name often heard but is accessible nevertheless to those who would take pleasure in exploring the unknown.   15:10,1
